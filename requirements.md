1. Overview
The application is a demo mobile dashboard built with React Native and Expo. Its primary function is to display the balance (in both native crypto units and USD) of a specific crypto wallet on the Coinbase Base blockchain. The wallet to be polled is not connected via a wallet integration but is instead entered manually in the app’s settings. The app will fetch the wallet’s balance via an appropriate blockchain API and convert the value into USD using current exchange rates.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Wallet Address Management
Settings Tab:
Provide a dedicated settings screen where the user can manually input and update a wallet address.
Validate the wallet address format to ensure it meets the expected criteria for the Coinbase Base blockchain.
Store the wallet address securely (preferably using Expo’s SecureStore or a similar mechanism).
Allow the user to update or delete the wallet address as needed.
2.2. Data Retrieval & Balance Display
Blockchain API Integration:

Integrate with a blockchain API (or a backend proxy) that supports the Coinbase Base blockchain to fetch the balance for the specified wallet address.
Handle API responses and errors gracefully (e.g., when the wallet address is invalid, API downtime, or network issues).
Exchange Rate Conversion:

Integrate with a trusted pricing API (such as CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, or Coinbase’s own API if available) to retrieve the current exchange rate for the native cryptocurrency to USD.
Convert the fetched crypto balance into USD using the most recent exchange rate.
Ensure proper precision and rounding for both crypto and fiat values.
2.3. User Interface & Interaction
Home/Dashboard Screen:

Display the following information:
The currently configured wallet address (or a masked version for privacy).
The wallet balance in native crypto units.
The equivalent balance in USD.
The timestamp indicating the last time the balance and exchange rate were updated.
Manual Data Refresh:

Provide a refresh button or pull-to-refresh functionality so the user can manually trigger an update of the balance and exchange rate.
(Optional) Indicate automatic refresh intervals if implemented (e.g., refresh every 60 seconds).
Error & Notification Handling:

Display clear error messages for situations such as:
Invalid or missing wallet address.
API errors (e.g., unable to fetch balance or exchange rate).
Network connectivity issues.
Provide user-friendly prompts or tips for troubleshooting.
2.4. Demo-Mode Specific Behavior
Preconfigured Demo Wallet:
(Optional) For demonstration purposes, allow the app to use a default wallet address if none is configured.
Clearly indicate in the UI that the wallet is a demo wallet and that the balance is being polled based on a preconfigured address if the user has not set one.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1. Performance & Responsiveness
Efficient API Calls:
Optimize API requests to reduce latency and ensure quick data retrieval.
Cache exchange rate data temporarily (with appropriate expiry) to minimize unnecessary API calls.
Smooth UI Experience:
Ensure that the user interface is responsive and provides visual feedback during data fetch operations (e.g., loading indicators).
3.2. Security
Data Storage:
Securely store the user’s wallet address using secure storage mechanisms provided by Expo.
Avoid logging sensitive information.
Secure Communication:
Use HTTPS for all API communications to ensure data integrity and privacy.
3.3. Usability & Accessibility
Intuitive Design:
Design a clean and simple UI that clearly guides the user on how to input a wallet address and view the balance.
Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, input fields) are easily accessible and clearly labeled.
Accessibility:
Follow accessibility best practices (such as proper contrast ratios, readable fonts, and support for screen readers).
3.4. Reliability & Error Handling
Robust Error Handling:
Implement error handling for API failures, invalid wallet addresses, and network issues.
Log errors locally (or through a remote monitoring solution) for troubleshooting purposes.
Offline Considerations:
Provide user feedback if the device is offline and unable to fetch data.
4. External Integrations & Dependencies
Blockchain Data Provider:

Select and integrate with a blockchain API provider that supports the Coinbase Base blockchain.
Ensure that the API provider offers reliable access to wallet balance data.
Exchange Rate API:

Integrate with an exchange rate API (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, or Coinbase API) to obtain current cryptocurrency-to-USD conversion rates.
Expo & React Native Libraries:

Leverage Expo’s managed workflow and libraries for secure storage, networking, and UI components.
Use community-supported libraries as needed (e.g., for input validation or network status detection).
5. Deployment & Maintenance Requirements
Development & Testing:

Use Expo’s development tools for rapid iteration and cross-platform testing on both iOS and Android.
Develop unit and integration tests for critical functionalities (wallet address validation, API data fetching, and conversion logic).
User Updates & Maintenance:

Plan for regular updates to accommodate API changes, security patches, and user feedback.
Monitor application performance and error logs to quickly identify and resolve issues.
Deployment:

Use Expo’s build services to generate production builds.
Prepare the app for deployment on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
Documentation:

Provide documentation for future developers, including setup instructions, API integration details, and troubleshooting guides.
