# Removed Tenderly Execution Check Code

This file documents the code that was removed from `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to prevent the 404 error that was appearing on the home screen. This code is not critical for the withdrawal process but is kept here for reference.

```javascript
// Step 3: Check for execution results
console.log('=============================================');
console.log('STEP 3: CHECKING COMBO EXECUTION');
console.log('=============================================');
console.log('üîç Checking combo execution at:', EXECUTIONS_URL);

// Using the execution with only Authorization header
try {
  const executionsUrl = `${EXECUTIONS_URL}?page=1&per_page=1`;
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è [COMPLETE FIX] Fetching Tenderly executions from URL:', executionsUrl);
  
  const executionsResponse = await fetch(executionsUrl, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${TENDERLY_API_KEY}`
    }
  });
  
  console.log('üìã Executions response status:', executionsResponse.status);
  
  if (executionsResponse.ok) {
    const executionsData = await executionsResponse.json();
    console.log('üìä Executions data:', JSON.stringify(executionsData));
    
    if (executionsData.executions && executionsData.executions.length > 0) {
      const execution = executionsData.executions[0];
      console.log('üìù Latest execution ID:', execution.id);
      console.log('üìù Execution status:', execution.status);
      
      // Log transactions if any
      if (execution.transactions && execution.transactions.length > 0) {
        execution.transactions.forEach((tx: any, index: number) => {
          console.log(`üìù Transaction ${index + 1}:`, tx.hash, 'Status:', tx.status);
        });
      } else {
        console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è No transactions found in execution');
      }
      
      // Log any errors
      if (execution.error) {
        console.error('‚ùå Execution error:', execution.error);
      }
      
      // Log specific logs if available
      if (execution.logs) {
        execution.logs.forEach((log: any, index: number) => {
          if (log.level === 'error') {
            console.error(`‚ùå Log ${index + 1}:`, log.message);
          } else {
            console.log(`üìú Log ${index + 1}:`, log.message);
          }
        });
      }
    } else {
      console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è No executions found');
    }
  } else if (executionsResponse.status === 404) {
    // This is expected in many cases and not an actual failure
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è 404 response when checking executions - this is normal behavior and doesn\'t affect the withdrawal');
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è The withdrawal will continue processing despite the 404 error');
  } else {
    console.error('‚ùå Failed to get executions with status:', executionsResponse.status);
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Continuing with the withdrawal process despite execution check failure');
  }
} catch (e: any) {
  console.error('‚ùå Error checking executions:', e.message || e);
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Continuing with the withdrawal process despite execution check error');
}
```

## Why This Code Was Removed

1. This code was causing a 404 error to appear on the home screen during withdrawals.
2. The error is expected and does not impact withdrawal functionality, but was negatively affecting user experience.
3. The execution check is not critical for the withdrawal process - the withdrawal still completes successfully without it.

## Alternative Implementation

If you still need to check execution results, consider:

1. Moving this check to a background process
2. Setting a flag to suppress visual error displays
3. Implementing a more robust error boundary around just this specific API call
